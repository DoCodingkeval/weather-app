This is a clean and visually engaging Weather Forecast App built using React. The interface allows users to search for any city and instantly view current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and date. It also displays a 4-day forecast with corresponding weather icons. The design features a scenic background with a transparent glassmorphism layout, making the information clear and appealing across different backgrounds. Real-time data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API, with temperature values converted from Kelvin to Celsius for better readability. The app uses Remix Icons for a modern UI, and ensures accessibility and responsiveness across devices.
